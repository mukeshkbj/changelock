# ChangeLock

An accounts-payable fraud command center. When a vendor asks to change where payments
are sent, ChangeLock holds the request, calls the vendor's **pre-existing trusted
contact** with CALL-E to ask one bounded question — *did your organization initiate
this change?* — and records the call as evidence for a human analyst.

It never approves, applies, or executes a payment change. Confirmed is evidence,
not authority.

## Why

Business email compromise and vendor bank-detail fraud cost billions a year. The
control auditors recommend is an out-of-band phone call to a number already on
file — not the number in the request. ChangeLock automates exactly that call, and
nothing else.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run db:seed   # optional; the app seeds itself on first run too
npm run dev       # or: npm run build && npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Four fictional cases are seeded. No credentials or
environment variables are needed — the app runs in **judge replay mode** by
default and cannot place a live call.

In a case workspace, pick a replay scenario, type the exact phrase
`VERIFY <SAFE_CASE_CODE>`, tick the attestation, and submit. The scenario result
flows through the same normalization, closed-schema parsing, and policy gates a
live CALL-E result would.

## The trust boundary

- The callback number in the request is treated as **attacker-controlled** and is
  never dialed. It is masked and stored as metadata only.
- The only number ChangeLock will ever dial is resolved server-side from
  `trustedContactId` against the vendor master record.
- Dispatch accepts only an `intentId`. Phone, task, schema, and provider mode are
  loaded from storage — nothing in the request body can steer a call.
- The intent (task text, contact, versions, destination fingerprint) is reserved
  and hashed **before** any provider I/O. The idempotency key is content-bound.

## The call contract

The agent discloses it is automated, names the buyer and vendor, states the safe
case code, asks the single yes/no question, forbids bank details, credentials,
and OTPs, stops on refusal, and states plainly that no change is approved. The
recipient result is a closed schema — any extra or malformed field fails closed.

## Dispositions

Confirmed and denied both require every gate: binding checks (call id, intent,
request hash, versions, destination fingerprint), terminal completed status,
schema-valid result, identity confirmed, safe case code confirmed, no sensitive
data, no opt-out, an answered change status, confidence ≥ 0.70, and evidence
present. Anything else — unreachable, unable to verify, refusal, sensitive-data
disclosure, malformed result — routes to `needs_human` or stays unverified. The
payment change stays `held` in every outcome.

Ambiguous provider acceptance moves the case to `submission_unknown` and never
auto-retries. Manual refresh can only poll an already-bound call id. In live
mode the operator can reconcile by entering the CALL-E call id from the
provider dashboard — the result is re-bound and re-evaluated only if every
binding check passes, otherwise the case moves to `needs_human` unbound — or
escalate directly to human review.

## Live mode (not required for judging)

`CHANGELOCK_MODE=live` plus `CALLE_API_KEY` and nonempty comma-separated
`CHANGELOCK_LIVE_CONTACT_ALLOWLIST` (consenting E.164 numbers) and
`CHANGELOCK_LIVE_REGION_ALLOWLIST` (e.g. `US`) enables the real `@call-e/calle`
SDK adapter (`calls.create` with the reserved idempotency key; `calls.get` for
refresh and reconciliation). Live authorization refuses before reserving unless
the trusted contact's number and region are both allowlisted; without all of
these, live dispatch refuses before any network I/O. Public/judge code paths
only ever construct replay intents.

## Public deployment (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t changelock .
docker run -p 3000:3000 changelock
```

The image runs only judge replay mode: `CHANGELOCK_MODE=replay` is baked in and
no `CALLE_API_KEY` or live allowlists exist inside it, so a public deployment is
structurally replay-only. The SQLite database lives at `/data/changelock.db`
and is intentionally ephemeral — on a fresh start the app re-seeds the four
fictional demo cases automatically. Do not mount a persistent disk for judging;
state resets are part of the demo contract. `render.yaml` deploys the same
image as a free web service with health check `/` and no disk.

## Verification

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test                 # unit + integration behavior tests
npm run build
npm run verify:no-secrets
```

## Honest limitations

Demo-grade. Fictional vendors only; no real-vendor onboarding, no RBAC/SSO, no
multi-tenancy, no webhooks (manual refresh instead), no transcript persistence.
Not a payment approval system and never will be.
